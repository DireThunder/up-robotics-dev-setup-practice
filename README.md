# up-robotics-dev-setup-practice

This repo is a hello world python repo for the purpose of getting all members of the 2018-2019 UP Robotics Club CS/EE team up to speed with our git workflow and python dev.
** if ANYTHING is confusing please ask! **

## install git if you don't have it:

These are the steps we will be using all year:

1. Fork the repo
2. make all your changes
3. test the changes locally
4. COMMIT your changes
5. FETCH & MERGE with master
6. Test again!
7. PUSH to your forked repo
8. Make a PULL REQUEST with the master repo 
9. Someone else should CHECKOUT the pull request, test it and then merge it in.


## FORK the repo 

'forking' this repo will make a copy of the code and store it under your username. This gives you a sandbox to test with before submitting to the master (main/important/should-always-work branch)

##Make Changes

If you don't have python 3 (NOT 2!) installed do that

If you don't have an IDE (somewhere to write and test code) get one (ex: Eclipse, Atom, VSCode or PyCharm or ???)

Make a change to the code!

##Test the changes locally

Run the code and make sure things are how you want

## COMMIT the changes

git add file_name_you_changed.py

git commit 


## FETCH & MERGE with master

git fetch

git merge

***if conflicts are found, resolve them**


## Test Again

make sure it still works

## Push to your forked Repo

git push 

## Make a PULL REQUEST with the master repo 

do this on github.com UI

## To approve a pull request

Someone who did not write the code should CHECKOUT the pull request and make sure things are behaving well and as hoped for. Then approve!

WOO HOO YOU ARE READY TO GO!
